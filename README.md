# PHP Phone Management System

A PHP-based phone management system demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming concepts including abstract classes, traits, inheritance, and database integration.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was created as a learning exercise to explore and implement various OOP concepts in PHP:

- **Abstract Classes**: `Phone` class serves as a base with abstract methods
- **Inheritance**: `Apple`, `Samsung`, and `Huawei` classes extend the base `Phone` class
- **Traits**: Modular features like `wirelessCharging`, `faceID`, `fingerprintId`, and `nativeAppMarketplace`
- **Namespaces**: Organized code structure with `PhoneManager` namespace
- **Database Integration**: MySQL connectivity using mysqli

## 🚨 Important Note

**I acknowledge that there are better, more secure, and more efficient ways to implement this system.** This project intentionally uses basic approaches to focus on learning OOP fundamentals rather than production-ready code.

## 🔧 Current Features

- **Database Connection**: MySQL connection handling
- **Phone Management**: Add different phone models from various manufacturers
- **Manufacturer-Specific Features**: Each brand implements unique characteristics
- **Trait System**: Modular features that can be mixed and matched
- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Insert phones into database

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
PhoneManager\
├── Connection (Database connectivity)
├── Phone (Abstract base class)
├── Traits (wirelessCharging, faceID, fingerprintId, nativeAppMarketplace)
└── Manufacturers (Apple, Samsung, Huawei)
```

### Manufacturers & Their Features

| Manufacturer | Wireless Charging | Authentication | App Store |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Apple        | MagSafe          | Face ID        | App Store |
| Samsung      | Qi Charging      | Fingerprint    | Google Play |
| Huawei       | Qi Charging      | Fingerprint    | App Gallery |

## 🚧 Current Limitations

- **Security**: Uses direct SQL queries (vulnerable to SQL injection)
- **No Input Validation**: Direct database insertion without sanitization
- **Command Line Only**: No user interface
- **Basic Error Handling**: Minimal error management
- **Hardcoded Values**: Database credentials and connection details

## 🚀 Future Plans (Next Version)

### Frontend Development
- **HTML Interface**: User-friendly web forms for phone management
- **CSS Styling**: Modern, responsive design
- **Interactive Features**: Dynamic phone addition and viewing

### Security Improvements
- **Prepared Statements**: Eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive data sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management system
- **Secure Configuration**: Environment-based database credentials

### Enhanced Functionality
- **User Authentication**: Login/logout system
- **Phone Editing**: Update existing phone information
- **Search & Filter**: Find phones by manufacturer, model, etc.
- **Data Export**: CSV/JSON export capabilities

## 📋 Setup Instructions

1. **Database Setup**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE devices;
   USE devices;
   
   CREATE TABLE phones (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       phone_make VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       phone_model VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       phone_storage VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
       screen_size VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
       phone_color VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

2. **Configuration**
   - Update database credentials in `Connection` class
   - Ensure MySQL server is running
   - Verify database name matches your setup

## 📝 Usage Example

```php
// Create a new iPhone
$iphone = new Apple(null, "Apple", "iPhone 15 Pro", "1TB", "6.1", "White Titanium");
$iphone->addDevice();

// Display phone information
echo $iphone->showDeviceInfo();
echo $iphone->enableWirelessCharging();
echo $iphone->enableFaceId();
echo $iphone->nativeAppMarketplace();
```
